I am a **collaborative** person who highly values **open science** and transparency. I enjoy working in a team with a shared vision. Within that team, I am happy to **lead projects**, to be creative, and to be independent. 

I enjoy academic writing, giving talks, and teaching.

My interests are fairly broad (from sex chromosomes to satellite biology to reproductive medicine), and I wish to apply my skills to advance biology, i.e. I am not interested in developing tools for others to use; nevertheless, I will develop such tools if it advances the **biological question** I am answering. I have an extensive knowledge of long reads (and next-gen in general) and always enjoy working on cutting edge technologies with all the inherent challenges.  

I am a biologist with a formal training in both computer science and statistics. 

I am currently located in Central Europe, so offers in that geographical area or those with options for remote and semi-remote work are especially appreciated.
