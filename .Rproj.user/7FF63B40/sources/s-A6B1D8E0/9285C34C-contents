Monika Cechova received her Ph.D. in Biology at Penn State where she studied the Y chromosome evolution in great apes, as well as applied long reads to explore heterochromatin in great apes under the supervision of prof. Kateryna Makova. Sheâ€™s interested in sex chromosomes, satellite biology, non-B DNA, and reproductive biology, as well as advances in the world of long reads and assembly. Her background in computer science positions her research at the interface of biology and bioinformatics.
